        What are spring boot proxies.
            Proxies bas wahi hai jo intercept karta hai method calls ko and lets us access the class variables and
            other members of the class. this helps us in logging monitoring and caching.
            Ki ha bhai I don't need to make db calls frequently if you are getting the same thing from the db again and again.
            @Cacheable ka use kar k
            Proxies me bhi we have two types
            1. JVM Proxies which use interface level proxies. Matlab isme hum interfaces k liye hi proxies use karsakte hai
            2. CGLIB Proxies. Isme hum sab classes k liye kar sakte hai
